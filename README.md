# Linear Regression

This project implements a simple linear regression model in Rust to predict outcomes based on a given dataset. Linear regression is a fundamental statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/): Ensure you have Rust installed on your system. You can install it using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).


### Installation 

Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pradene/linear_regression.git
```

### Usage

- Train the model
```bash
cargo run --bin train
```

- See the data and linear regression result inside a graph
```bash
cargo run --bin visualize
```

- Predict price based on a km
```bash
cargo run --bin predict
```
